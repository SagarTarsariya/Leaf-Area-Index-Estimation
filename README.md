LAI estimation of wheat and rice in Himachal Pradesh using machine learning algorithms 

Project Title: Estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) for Wheat and Rice Crops using Machine Learning
Objective: To explore the relationship between vegetation indices and LAI and apply machine learning algorithms for accurate LAI estimation in wheat and rice crops.
Scope: The project focused on the study area of Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, and included data collection, preprocessing, and analysis of remote sensing data for wheat and rice crops.
Methodology: The project involved collecting satellite imagery data from Google Earth Engine, extracting vegetation indices such as NDVI, EVI, GNDVI, RENDVI, WDRVI, CI, and NDRE, and applying machine learning algorithms including linear regression, random forest regressor, support vector machine regressor, KNeighbors regressor, and gradient boosting regressor.
Results: The analysis revealed strong correlations between certain vegetation indices and LAI for both wheat and rice crops. The random forest regressor achieved an impressive R2 score of 0.97 for rice, while the gradient boosting regressor yielded an R2 score of 0.91 for wheat.
Skills Utilized: Data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, data analysis, and interpretation.
Collaboration: The project was conducted individually.
Timeframe: The project was completed over a period of four months.
Key Responsibilities: The project involved data collection, preprocessing, model implementation, performance evaluation, and result interpretation.
Learnings: The project provided valuable insights into the use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms for accurate LAI estimation in agricultural settings. It enhanced skills in data analysis, model development, and understanding the relationship between vegetation indices and LAI.
